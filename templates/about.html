  <h3>Hello,</h3>
  <p>
    <span>As</span> you can tell, my name is Anthony Vu and I am a Front-End Web Developer.
    I am also an optometrist, climbing hobbyist, guitar enthusiast, and a
    self-proclaimed bicycle mechanic. I am constantly looking for a new
    challenge that expands my abilities and helps me produce quality work in an
    efficient manner. I am searching for an environment would allow me to grow
    not only as a developer but also as a worker, a friend, and
    a person. Please use the contents of this website to learn about me, my
    projects, and to contact me if you have any questions or inquires.
